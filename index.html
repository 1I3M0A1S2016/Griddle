						<h1>Griddle is a simple grid component for use with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>.</h1>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3>Configurable</h3>
						Beyond using Bootstrap 3, Griddle makes few assumptions about how your grid should be styled. Griddle grids render as simple tables that you can apply your site's styling to. 
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3>Functional</h3>
						Out of the box, Griddle has sorting, filtering, paging and some user customization such as column selection and results per page. Additionally, Griddle supports simple sub-grids and even more complex functionality is on the roadmap.
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h3>Fast</h3>
						Griddle is powered by React and its virtual DOM. Only the current page of the grid is rendered at any given time. Whether you have several or thousands of records, Griddle should render your data quickly.

				<h2>Base Example</h2>
				At the most basic level, creating a Griddle component is as simple as saying <pre class="inline"><code class="language-markup">&lt;Griddle results= {fakeData} gridClassName="table"/&gt;</code></pre> against an array of JSON objects (fakeData is the array in this example).
				<hr />
				<div id="grid" class="container"></div>

		<section id="example2">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>More Advanced Example</h2>
				For many applications, simple paging and sorting is not enough. Griddle comes equipped with filtering, initial columns and additional grid settings out of the box. To use these features, simply define the <span class="highlight">showProperties</span> and <span class="highlight">showFilters</span> properties on the Griddle component definition. <a href="#properties">Check out the full list of properties</a> below.

			</div>

		<section id="example3">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Subgrids</h2>
				Griddle also supports subgrids with little configuration. Simply add a property named "children" (or set the child column name property when defining the component) to any object in your list of data. Right now the child rows should have the same columns as the parent but more advanced subgrid functionality is planned.
