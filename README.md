**GRIDDLE IS VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT**

----------

Griddle is a simple grid Component for use with React. It depends on [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) (as well as [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)). 

To Use Griddle, include griddle.js / griddle.css below the requirements listed above. From there, simply create a Griddle component in your jsx as so `<Griddle results= {data} />`. There are several additional properties that can be used to change the behavior of the component:

- **Columns** - The columns that should be displayed. Any items that have a different key than one contained in the *Columns* array will not be displayed in the table. It will still be available in the column chooser. The default is an empty array which will show all columns.
- **resultsPerPage** - The number of records to show on a given page. The default value is 10 
- **initialSort** - The column to sort on initially. By default this is not set.   
- **gridClassName** - The css class/classes to apply to the grid table element. The default is `table` which  applies some Bootstrap table styling. 

To try it out, run the following commands: 

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have grunt.
2. `npm install`
3. `grunt`
4. That's it!
